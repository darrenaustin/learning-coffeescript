# Learning CoffeeScript #

These are the code artifacts of my run through 
[CoffeeScript: Accelerated JavaScript Development][coffee]
by Trevor Burnham

Pretty good book.  Nicely written in a conversational style, and it
moved at a fast, but manageable pace.  My only complaint was that it
didn't always give complete directions on how to assemble the various
parts of the application that is was building.  In addition there were
parts of the code that weren't described in the book but were required
to get the application running.  I understand that he didn't want
entire listings in the book, but it would have been nice if he had
been more explicit about when he was leaving something needed out.

Also, I ran into a version problem using the latest Socket.io package.
Never quite got the client-server version of the 5x5 word game to work
due to this.  May revisit at a later time.
